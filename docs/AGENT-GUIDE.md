# LicketySplit AI Agent — User Guide

LicketySplit can be edited by an AI agent of your choice. The same tool layer powers
three surfaces:

- **Web BYOK chat** — chat with a model inside the browser editor.
- **Desktop MCP server** — connect external MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor,
  Cline) to the running desktop app.
- **Headless runner** — edit a stored project from a server/CLI with no app open.

All three drive the same current [capability set](./AGENT-CAPABILITIES.md),
including `execute_action`/`batch_actions` escape hatches, so an agent can
perform the full set of project-backed edits the web editor exposes: import
media, build the timeline, trim, crop, transform, color-grade, mix audio, add
text/shapes/subtitles, keyframe, manage transitions, build Motion Creator
compositions and editable 3D scenes, and export the result.

## Bring Your Own Key (web & desktop chat)

1. Open **Settings → API Keys**. In the browser, create a master password and
   unlock the session; the password is not stored.
2. Add an **OpenAI** or **Anthropic** API key. Browser keys are encrypted locally
   with AES-256-GCM; desktop keys use the protected native credential store. LicketySplit
   does not persist keys on its servers. In the hosted web build, the key is
   forwarded through the same-origin API proxy for that request; in local
   development the browser calls the provider directly; on desktop the native
   process reads the key from its secure store.
3. Open or create a project, then open the **AI Editor** panel (the robot icon
   in the toolbar).
4. Use the AI settings button in the panel header to pick a provider and model.
   Choose a listed model or select **Custom model ID…** and enter any
   tool-calling model ID enabled for your provider account.
5. Describe an edit in plain language, e.g.
   _"trim the first clip to 5s, add a fade-in, and put a title card at the start."_

### Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

Choose **OpenAI-compatible** to use a hosted alternative, self-hosted model, or
local runtime that implements the OpenAI Chat Completions tool-calling format.

1. Enter its base URL, for example `https://provider.example/v1` or
   `http://localhost:11434/v1`. Pasting the complete `/chat/completions` URL is
   also supported.
2. Enter the exact model ID exposed by that endpoint.
3. If authentication is required, add the optional **OpenAI-compatible** key in
   **Settings → API Keys**. Keyless endpoints work without secure-storage setup.

Compatible requests go directly from the browser to the configured endpoint;
they are never relayed through the app's hosted proxy. The endpoint must allow
CORS for the app's origin. Use the desktop app for local HTTP endpoints or
servers that do not expose browser CORS headers—the native process performs the
request there. URL credentials and query strings are rejected; store bearer
credentials in the encrypted API-key field instead.

The selected model must support the standard `tools` and `tool_calls` fields.
A text-only OpenAI-compatible model can chat, but cannot control the editor.

### Controls

- **Confirm gate** — destructive or expensive actions (delete, remove, export,
  AI jobs) pause for your approval by default.
- **Auto-approve** (shield icon) — run destructive actions without prompting.
- **Dry-run** (flask icon) — plan the tool calls without applying any mutation.
- **Undo this turn** — reverts an entire AI turn as one history entry.
- **Stop** — aborts the in-flight turn and rolls back any partial edits.
- **Token meter** — shows cumulative input/output tokens for the conversation.

The chat automatically sends only the relevant portion of the complete tool
registry on each turn. This keeps requests within provider function limits
while retaining access to every editor domain across requests. Follow-up turns
also keep tools used earlier in the conversation available.

### Troubleshooting

- **“Unlock secure storage”** — open **Settings → API Keys** and unlock with the
  master password created on this browser.
- **“No API key configured”** — add a key for the provider currently selected in
  the AI settings popover. OpenAI and Anthropic keys are separate.
- **401 / authentication error** — replace the stored key and confirm it belongs
  to the selected provider.
- **Model not found / unavailable** — choose a listed model, or enter the exact
  model ID enabled for your provider account. Availability can differ by account.
- **Compatible endpoint cannot be reached** — verify the base URL, ensure the
  server implements `/chat/completions`, and enable CORS when using the browser.
- **An edit needs approval** — approve the inline confirmation, or enable the
  shield toggle only for a project and key you trust.

## Connecting external agents (desktop MCP)

The desktop app runs a local Model Context Protocol server so external clients
can drive your open project.

1. Open **Settings → MCP** (desktop only).
2. The panel shows the loopback URL and a bearer token (rotate it any time).
3. Copy the client config snippet into your MCP client. It points at the bundled
   `licketysplit-mcp` stdio shim, which bridges your client to the running app:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "licketysplit": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["<path to licketysplit-mcp shim>"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. By default, destructive/expensive tool calls over MCP are refused with a
   "confirmation required" notice. Enable **Trusted local — auto-allow** to let
   trusted local clients run them.
5. Use **Test connection** to verify the server is reachable.

The HTTP transport binds to `127.0.0.1` only and rejects any request without the
bearer token.

## Headless / automated edits (CLI)

The `@licketysplit/agent-runner` package edits a stored project with no app open —
useful for batch edits, "apply this recipe to N projects", and scheduled jobs.

```bash
licketysplit-agent \
  --project ./reel.json \
  --prompt "Add a title that says Welcome for the first 3 seconds" \
  --provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-5 \
  --out ./reel.edited.json
```

- The API key is read from `LICKETYSPLIT_API_KEY` (or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and is used per-request only — never stored or logged.
- `--dry-run` plans without applying mutations.
- In-app render/export jobs use the local web or desktop export engine. The
  headless CLI edits project files but does not submit work to a remote GPU.

## Safety & limits

- **Atomic turns** — every turn is one undoable transaction; a fatal error rolls
  back the whole turn.
- **Cost ceiling** — an optional per-turn token budget stops a runaway turn.
- **Rate limiting** — provider 429/5xx responses are retried with exponential
  backoff.
